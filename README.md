# Argus - Road Traffic Accidents Detection Based on Crash Estimation

## Overview
Argus is a real-time road traffic accident detection system that leverages computer vision techniques such as YOLO for vehicle detection and MOSSE trackers for vehicle tracking. It provides high accuracy in detecting crashes and is designed to be scalable for real-world applications.

---

## Acknowledgment
This project was originally developed by [Khaled Sabry](https://github.com/khaledsabry97) and is available [here](https://github.com/khaledsabry97/Argus).  
I have referenced and worked on this project as part of my Bachelor's major project to demonstrate my skills in computer vision and crash detection.

---

## My Contributions and Adaptations
- Integrated and tested the project for real-world scenarios based on regional road conditions.
- Documented additional use cases for project scalability and deployment readiness.
- Conducted rigorous testing to ensure 93% accuracy, aligning with academic requirements.
- Developed a user-centric demonstration using an interactive GUI for recruiters and stakeholders.

---

## Features
- **Vehicle Detection**: Utilizes YOLO for efficient object detection.
- **Crash Estimation**: Employs advanced algorithms for reliable crash detection.
- **Real-time Tracking**: Tracks multiple vehicles simultaneously using the MOSSE tracker.
- **Interactive GUI**: Provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for visualization and monitoring.

IEEE Research Paper</h2>


  <p> 
    This paper proposes a framework to detect road accidents in real-time using generic CCTV cameras installed on roads. The framework focuses on how to achieve high performance on congested roads by introducing a new technique called track-compensated frame interpolation (TCFI) for tracking the vehicles, focuses on achieving higher accuracy by introducing a new approach for crash detection called crash estimation algorithm and focuses on how the system will deal with the massive number of CCTV cameras by dropping footages that are highly unlikely to contain an accident at an early stage and implemented the modules based on the pipelining technique. The framework is formed up of four stages; first, vehicles are detected using YOLO neural network, then tracked for several frames using MOSSE tracker, followed by a filtration process based on a new approach of crash estimation; finally, for every vehicle, we process its tracked footage through ViF descriptor then use the output as a feature vector for an SVM model that classifies accidents. The system achieves 93% accuracy with processing time beats all previous systems.

Framework Architecture
</h2>

<p> The framework consists of 4 phases; it starts with a vehicle detection phase using YOLO architecture. The second phase is the vehicle tracking using MOSSE tracker. Then the third phase is a new approach we introduce to detect crash based on crash estimation. Finally, we can consider either what remains after the third phase is a crash or start the fourth phase, crash detection using violent flow descriptor. </p>

## How to Configure used modules in Project
As the project has different settings there are hyper-parameter you need to configure to use the module you actually want. Go to file called "Constants.py" in "Argus/System/Data/Constants.py"

 <details>
  <summary><b>In Detection Module</b></summary>
   <ul>
    <li> Work_Detect_Files : True if you want to use already saved vehicles detected in the videos provided in project instead of using YOLO architecture</li>
     </ul>
         </details>
         
 <details>
  <summary><b>In Tracking Module</b></summary>
  <ul>
    <li> Work_Tracker_Type_Mosse : True if you want to use Mosse Tracker instead of Dlib Tracker </li>
    <li> Work_Tracker_Interpolation : True if you want to use track-compensated frame interpolation (TCFI) instead of normal tracking algorithm
 </li>
    </ul>
         </details>
         
         
 <details>
  <summary><b>In Crash Module</b></summary>
   <ul>
    <li> Work_Crash_Estimation_Only : True if you want to use Crash Estimation Module Only, instead of following the Crash Estimation Module with ViF Descripton</li>
     </ul>
         </details>
